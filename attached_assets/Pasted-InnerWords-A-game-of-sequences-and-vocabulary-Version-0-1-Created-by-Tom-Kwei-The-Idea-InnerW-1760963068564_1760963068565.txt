InnerWords
A game of sequences and vocabulary

Version 0.1 — Created by Tom Kwei

🧠 The Idea
InnerWords is a turn-based word game for two or more players.

You begin with a single long word and take turns forming new
words from it by using a continuous sequence of letters found
within the current word.
It’s simple to play, but rewards creativity, vocabulary, and forward
thinking.

⚙️ How to Play
1. Start with a Word
Choose a long, familiar English word of 8–12 letters — for
example: OBNOXIOUS, DERMATOLOGY, or HAMBURGER.

Players can agree on one together or randomise it using a
dictionary or word generator.

2. Take Turns
On your turn:
● Choose a contiguous sequence of letters from the current
word.
It must be at least two letters long, but can be any length, as
long as the letters are consecutive.
Example: from DERMATOLOGY, you could take DER, MAT,
ATO, TO, OLOG, or OGY, etc.
● Using that exact sequence, form a new valid English word
by adding letters only to the start or end. You cannot insert
letters inside the sequence or rearrange them.
✅ Example: DERMATOLOGY → “MAT” → MATERIAL
❌ Not allowed: DERMATOLOGY → “MAT” → MEATY (adds an
E inside “MAT”)
The newly created word becomes the next starting word for your
opponent.

🧮 Scoring
Words are scored according to both where the chosen sequence
comes from and how much the new word expands.
Choosing a sequence that includes the first or last letter of the
current word is called an Edge Sequence — each letter in that
sequence scores 1 point. For example in DERMATOLOGY, DE,

DERM, DERMA or GY,OGY, OLOGY would be considered Edge
Sequences.
If you instead take your sequence from within the word (not
touching either end), it’s called an Inner Sequence, and each
letter in that sequence scores 2 points.
You also gain a Length Bonus if your new word is longer than
the previous one. You earn 1 extra point for every additional
letter in the new word. No bonus is applied if your word is equal in
length to or shorter than your opponent’s.

Example:
CORRECTION → “REC” → RECONNAISSANCE
● Player 1 earns 10 points:
○ “REC” = 3 letters × 2 points (Inner Sequence) = 6
points
○ RECONNAISSANCE is 4 letters longer = +4 bonus
○ Total = 10 points

RECONNAISSANCE → “ANCE” → DISTANCE
● Player 2 earns 4 points:

○ “ANCE” = 4 letters × 1 point (Edge Sequence) = 4
points
○ DISTANCE is shorter = no length bonus

○ Total = 4 points

🔁 Winning the Game
Play for a set number of rounds (commonly six) or to a target
score (for example, first to 50 points).
Keep a running total of each player’s score — the player with the
highest total at the end wins.

🎯 Strategy and Tactics
Although InnerWords looks simple, it quickly develops into a
game of real strategy and foresight.
Because every new word sets up the next round, players must
constantly think not only about the points they earn now, but also
about the letters and sequences they leave behind for their
opponent.
Some key tactical approaches include:
● Inner-first play: Target inner sequences whenever possible
to maximise multipliers, even if it means shorter words.
Smart players chain inner segments to control tempo.
● Edge denial: Take sequences from the start or end of the
word to remove accessible openings, forcing your opponent
into weaker inner options.

● Future blocking: Visualise what follow-up sequences might
exist in your new word and play defensively to close them
off.

● Growth gambit: Extend shorter sequences into much longer
words for hefty length bonuses, but beware — the longer the
word, the more options you might hand over next turn.
● Tempo control: Mix shorter, defensive plays with long, risky
builds to unsettle opponents and shift the rhythm of play.

● Theme chaining (optional rule): Some players try linking
words semantically (e.g. “FIRE → IRON → FURNACE”) —
not required, but it adds creativity and flair.

At higher levels, InnerWords becomes a battle of pattern
recognition, risk management, and lexical imagination —
rewarding those who can see not just the next word, but the next
three.
